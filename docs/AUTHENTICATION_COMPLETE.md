## 💡 Tips for Development

### **Adding New Views**
Always use decorators:
```python
from authentication.decorators import student_required

@student_required
def my_view(request):
    # Your code
    pass
```

### **Accessing User Data in Templates**
```django
{% if session.user %}
    {{ session.user.full_name }}
    {{ session.user.role }}
    {{ session.user.verification_status }}
{% endif %}
```

### **Creating Protected URLs**
```python
from authentication.decorators import teacher_verified_required

@teacher_verified_required
def create_course(request):
    # Only verified teachers can access
    pass
```
