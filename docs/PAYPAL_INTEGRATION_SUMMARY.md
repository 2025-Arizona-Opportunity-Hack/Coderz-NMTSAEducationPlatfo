## üìã Changes Made

### 1. **Backend Infrastructure**

#### **New File: `nmtsa_lms/nmtsa_lms/paypal_service.py`**

  - `PayPalClient` singleton class for client management
  - `create_order()` - Creates PayPal orders for course purchases
  - `capture_order()` - Captures/completes payments after user approval
  - `get_order_details()` - Retrieves order status
  - Full error handling and logging
  - Support for both sandbox and live environments

#### **Updated: `nmtsa_lms/nmtsa_lms/settings.py`**
- Added PayPal configuration variables:
  - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` - From environment variable
  - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` - From environment variable
  - `PAYPAL_MODE` - 'sandbox' or 'live' (defaults to sandbox)
- Added validation warning if PayPal credentials not configured

#### **Updated: `nmtsa_lms/student_dash/views.py`**
- Added imports for PayPal service and Payment model
- Added `create_paypal_order()` view - API endpoint for creating orders
- Added `capture_paypal_order()` view - API endpoint for capturing payments
- Updated `checkout_course()` to pass PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID to template

#### **Updated: `pyproject.toml`**
- Added dependency: `paypal-checkout-serversdk>=1.0.1`

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
You need to add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# PayPal Sandbox Credentials
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id_here
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_client_secret_here
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
```

**Where to get these:**
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/
2. Navigate to Apps & Credentials
3. Switch to "Sandbox" mode
4. Use the credentials from your sandbox app
5. Copy Client ID and Secret

---

## üß™ How to Test the Integration

### Prerequisites
1. **Install the new dependency:**
   ```powershell
   cd nmtsa_lms
   uv pip install paypal-checkout-serversdk
   ```

2. **Update your `.env` file** with PayPal sandbox credentials (see above)

3. **Run migrations** (if not already done):
   ```powershell
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Testing Flow

#### Step 1: Create a Paid Course
1. Login as a teacher
2. Navigate to teacher dashboard
3. Create a new course
4. Set `is_paid = True`
5. Set a price (e.g., $49.99)
6. Publish the course

#### Step 2: Test Payment as Student
1. **Login as a student** (or create new student account)
2. Navigate to **Course Catalog** (`/student/catalog/`)
3. Find the paid course you created
4. Click on the course to view details
5. Click **"Enroll"** or **"Checkout"** button
6. You should see the checkout page with:
   - Your billing information (name, email)
   - A **PayPal button** (gold/blue)
   - A loading indicator initially, then the button appears

#### Step 3: Complete Payment with Sandbox Account
1. Click the **PayPal button**
2. A PayPal popup window will open
3. **Login with PayPal sandbox test account:**
   - Use your sandbox **Personal account** credentials
   - Found in: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accounts
   - Example: `sb-xxxxx@personal.example.com`
4. **Review the payment** in the popup
5. Click **"Pay Now"** or **"Complete Purchase"**
6. The popup will close
7. You'll see "Processing payment..." message
8. Success message appears
9. Automatically redirects to the course learning page

#### Step 4: Verify Database Records
Check that the following were created:
- **Enrollment record**: `authentication_enrollment` table
- **Payment record**: `authentication_payment` table with:
  - `status = 'completed'`
  - `paypal_order_id` populated
  - `paypal_payment_id` populated
  - `payer_email` and `payer_name` from PayPal

#### Step 5: Test Edge Cases

**Test: Already Enrolled**
- Try to checkout same course again
- Should show error: "You are already enrolled"

**Test: Cancel Payment**
- Click PayPal button
- Close the popup without paying
- Should return to checkout page (no error)

**Test: Free Course**
- Create a course with `is_paid = False`
- Try to enroll
- Should enroll immediately without PayPal

**Test: Network Error**
- Turn off WiFi briefly during payment
- Should show user-friendly error message

## üîê Security Features Implemented

1. **CSRF Protection**: All AJAX requests include CSRF token
2. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require student login
3. **Authorization Checks**: Verify user can access the course
4. **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate enrollments and charges
5. **Transaction Atomicity**: Database operations wrapped in transactions
6. **No Card Data**: Payment info never touches your server
7. **PCI Compliance**: All handled by PayPal
8. **Secure Credentials**: Secrets stored in environment variables
9. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated
10. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures

---

## üìä Database Schema (Existing Payment Model Used)

The existing `Payment` model in `authentication/models.py` is already perfectly structured:

```python
class Payment(models.Model):
    # Relations
    user = ForeignKey(User)
    course = ForeignKey(Course)
    
    # PayPal details
    paypal_order_id = CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    paypal_payment_id = CharField(max_length=255)
    payer_email = EmailField()
    payer_name = CharField(max_length=255)
    
    # Payment info
    amount = DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    currency = CharField(max_length=3, default='USD')
    status = CharField(choices=STATUS_CHOICES)  # pending/completed/failed/refunded
    
    # Timestamps
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    completed_at = DateTimeField(null=True)
    updated_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you have additional time, consider:

1. **Email Notifications**: Send receipt email after successful payment
2. **Refund Support**: Add admin ability to refund payments
3. **Payment History**: Student page to view all their payments
4. **Revenue Dashboard**: Admin dashboard showing payment analytics
5. **Webhooks**: Implement PayPal webhooks for async updates
6. **Failed Payment Recovery**: Allow students to retry failed payments

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: PayPal Button Not Showing
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Verify `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` is set in `.env`

### Issue: "Failed to create order"
**Solution**: Check Django logs. Verify PayPal credentials are correct. Ensure `paypal-checkout-serversdk` is installed.

### Issue: "Payment capture failed"
**Solution**: Check if order was already captured. Verify PayPal sandbox account has sufficient funds.

### Issue: Payment succeeds but no enrollment
**Solution**: Check Django logs for errors. Verify database transaction completed. Check Payment record status.

### Issue: CSRF token errors
**Solution**: Ensure CSRF middleware is enabled. Check cookie settings. Clear browser cache.

## üìù Important Notes

### Non-Breaking Implementation
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Free courses still work without PayPal
- ‚úÖ Existing enrollment system unchanged
- ‚úÖ Previous checkout flow available as fallback
- ‚úÖ No database migrations required (Payment model already exists)

### Sandbox vs Production
- Currently configured for **sandbox only**
- Do NOT use for real payments
- Test accounts use fake money
- To go live: Change `PAYPAL_MODE=live` and use live credentials

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Type hints where applicable
- ‚úÖ Docstrings on all functions
- ‚úÖ Security best practices followed
- ‚úÖ No placeholders or TODOs left
