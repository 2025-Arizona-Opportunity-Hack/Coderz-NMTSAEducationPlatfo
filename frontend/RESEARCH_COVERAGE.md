## 📝 Intentional Design Decisions

### Simplified vs Research.md

1. **Account Settings**: Basic profile management in Dashboard instead of dedicated page

   - Reason: Avoids over-engineering, user settings accessible from Dashboard

2. **Teacher Application**: Combined with student applications in single page

   - Reason: Shared form logic, cleaner UX, role-based field display

3. **Progress/Theme/Notification Stores**: Not created as separate stores

   - Reason: Functionality handled by existing systems (API, i18next, HeroUI)
   - Result: Cleaner, less redundant code

4. **Home Page**: Simplified hero + features instead of complex carousel/testimonials

   - Reason: Explore page already provides comprehensive course browsing
   - Result: Faster load time, clearer user journey

5. **Certificates**: Integrated into Dashboard instead of separate page
   - Reason: Natural fit with Dashboard tabs, better UX flow
   - Enhancement: Added social sharing (LinkedIn, Twitter, copy link)
